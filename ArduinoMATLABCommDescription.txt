Communication Setup between MATLAB and Arduino

Notes:
- baud rate 115200
- communication is only set up once between MATLAB and Arduino, but MATLAB code
  does not currently include section for disconnecting serial connection

process for opening communication with Arduino and initializing SD card
(in chronological order):

Arduino: stuck in while loop in setup(), waiting for MATLAB input
MATLAB:  sends "MATLAB ready for transmission" over Serial, stuck in while
         loop until callback function is triggered
Arduino: attempts to open SD card, if it fails sends "SD-fail" to MATLAB,
         otherwise sends "SD-success"
MATLAB:  callback function is triggered with either "SD-fail" or "SD-success"
         from Arduino, if SD initialization failed gets stuck in indefinite
         while loop


process for communicating trajectory to Arduino:

Arduino: now in loop() section, waits for instruction from MATLAB
MATLAB:  sends "instr1" over serial, stuck in while loop until Arduino
         acknowledges instruction
Arduino: sends "received," which allows MATLAB to break out of while loop
Arduino/MATLAB: MATLAB sends trajectory vector to Arduino. It then waits
		to send the next one until Arduino sends "ready for vector".
		MATLAB sends trajectory points to Arduino, which stores
                them on SD card. 
Arduino: once the entire trajectory has been communicated, Arduino will
         send "Done receiving trajectory". Arduino then transitions to
         waiting for instruction.


process for running trajectory using Arduino:

Arduino: in loop() section, waiting for instruction from MATLAB
MATLAB:  sends "instr2" over serial, stuck in while loop until Arduino
         acknowledges instruction
Arduino: sends "received," which allows MATLAB to break out of while loop
Arduino: starts running trajectory stored on SD card. sends "start instr2" 
	 to MATLAB. The time it is run at, along with the trajectory data
	 performed, are sent via Serial to MATLAB. Arduino also sends 
	 "get IMU" to MATLAB, which causes MATLAB to record current IMU
         orientation
MATLAB:  displays trajectory data and times on user console
Arduino: upon finishing trajectory, Arduino sends "done instr2", then
	 transitions to waiting for instruction
